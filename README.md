## Game Launcher – Nightmare Studio

This is a custom game launcher created for educational purposes and for fun.  
It was designed to give players easy access to all my games published on itch.io, including early and experimental versions.

With this launcher, users can:
- Download all available versions of my games
- Launch games directly from the launcher
- Uninstall games
- Read news related to Nightmare Studio
- Automatically update the launcher when a new version is available

The launcher is built in C# using Windows Forms (WinForms).  
The full source code is available on GitHub and was published directly from Visual Studio using Git.
